In this activity, I will be building a compatibility-based "FriendFinder" application. It's basically a dating app. This full-stack site will take in results from your users' surveys. then compare their answers with those from other users. The app will then display the name and picture of the user with the best overall match. I will use Express to handle routing. I'll make sure to deploy my app to Heroku so other users can fill it out.
