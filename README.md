# Friend-Finder---Node-and-Express-Servers-Overview

Using Express

Overview
In this unit, I will create my own server-side APIs using the Express.js framework. Express is the most widely used Node.js server framework. It will allow us to quickly and easily establish our API routes and associated HTTP request methods.

Routing is how we design our server to handle responses when a client makes a request at a specific endpoint, or URL. I learned how to make GET requests from the client-side in a previous unit. Now I will learn how those requests are handled on the server-side. My server will listen for a specific type of request at a specific endpoint and when it hears that request, it will respond accordingly.

I also learned the HTTP POST request method to submit data to our server:

In this activity, you'll build a compatibility-based "FriendFinder" application -- basically a dating app. This full-stack site will take in results from your users' surveys, then compare their answers with those from other users. The app will then display the name and picture of the user with the best overall match. I will use Express to handle routing. I'll make sure to deploy my app to Heroku so other users can fill it out.
